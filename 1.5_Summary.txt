Take aways:

- Always write down analysis/observations/conclusions after the plots
- Dont forget the objective of the EDA

Terms:

1. Univariate analysis --> analysing 1 variable/features. Ex: PDF, CDF, box-plot, violine plot, etc.
2. bivariate analysis --> analysing 2 variables/features. Ex: scatter plot, pair plot, etc.
3. multivariate analysis --> more than 2 variables/features. Ex: 3D scatter plot
