# Exploratory Data Analysis {EDA}

<strong> What is Exploratory Data Analysis {EDA} ? </strong>
- Analyse data with using tools such as stats, linear algebra and other tools

<strong> Why EDA ?  </strong>
- important stage before ML modelling 
- understand data better so that choosing ML model would be easier

<strong> How EDA ?  </strong>
- With usage of plotting libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn etc
- with usage of stats and other libraries for gaining insights on data

# EDA Mind Map

# 1D plot: Scatter plot

# 1D plot: Histogram & Density Plot {petal_length feature}

# Multivariate Analysis 

- using <strong> Joint Plot </strong> for petal_width & petal_length features.
